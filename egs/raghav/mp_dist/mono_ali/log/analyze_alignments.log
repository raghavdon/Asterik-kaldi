The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 56.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 46.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 30.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 28.9 hours of data, or 12.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 7.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (69,90.4,231)
