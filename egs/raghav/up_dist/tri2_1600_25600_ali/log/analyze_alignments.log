The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 57.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 47.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 33.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 28.9 hours of data, or 12.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 8.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (64,85.8,226)
