Overall, SIL accounts for 37.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (146,171.4,383) frames.
Overall, n_E accounts for 13.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,21.8,56) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 10.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,14.0,34) frames.
Overall, h_B accounts for 10.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.7,18) frames.

Overall, h_I accounts for 4.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,8.4,20) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 4.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,14.7,38) frames.
Overall, ii_I accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,6.7,15) frames.
Overall, ii_E accounts for 1.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,48.2,116) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 88.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 11.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
