Overall, SIL accounts for 38.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (148,171.0,383) frames.
Overall, n_E accounts for 12.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,25.9,62) frames.
Overall, n_B accounts for 10.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,10.1,26) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,13.1,32) frames.
Overall, h_B accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,9.1,20) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 6.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,25.4,65) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 3.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,8.4,19) frames.
Overall, h_I accounts for 3.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,7.3,14) frames.
Overall, ii_I accounts for 2.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,7.2,16) frames.
Overall, ii_E accounts for 1.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,67.4,355) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 87.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 11.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
